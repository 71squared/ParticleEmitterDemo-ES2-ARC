ParticleEmitterDemo-ES2-ARC
===========================

Sample project showing a number of particle systems running in an OpenGL ES 2.0 + ARC based project.

This project provides the basic elements needed to create an OpenGL ES 2.0 context and then load and run a particle system configured inside Particle Designer. Custom shaders are used to render the particle system. No 3rd party frameworks are required so this code can easily be built into your own project.
